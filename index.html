  <h1>Similarities between being a software engineer and an intro to computer science student</h1>
<dl>
  <dt><b>collaboration</b></dt>
  <dd>Both the syllabus and the video highlight the importance of <b>collaboration</b>. We will be undertaking tasks in pairs this semester, similarly to how Mayuko <b>collaborates</b> with product teams to decide what to build.</dd>
  <hr />
<dt>peer review</dt>
  <dd>Mayuko stressed the importance of <b>peer reviewing,</b> another activity that will play an integral role in our course. In fact, this skill is not only applicable in computer science, but rather, it plays an essential role in in other fields such as biology, chemistry, and physics. The <b>peer review</b> process is a fundamental step in any research effort because scholars must use their knowledge of their field to aid others in making their work more effective and clear, just as we must do in this class. </dd>
  <hr />
<dt>Goal-focused</dt>
<dd>The syllabus gives us details on how to assess our own work. We must go above and beyond if we wish to earn a perfect score, and Mayuko shares a related point: she accentuates the importance of working for an superb end <b>product or goal</b> rather than focusing on a trivial grade. Even though this course is part of our GPA, it is more important to be working to create a high-quality finished product rather than just working for a grade.</dd>
