<dt>collaboration</dt>
<dd>Both the syllabus and the video highlight the importance of collaboration. We will be undertaking tasks in pairs this semester, similarly to how Mayuko collaborates with product teams to decide what to build.</dd>
<dt>peer review</dt>
<dd>Mayuko stressed the importance of peer reviewing, another activity that will play an integral role in our course. In fact, this skill is not only applicable in computer science, but rather , it plays an essential role in in other fields such as biology, chemistry, and physics. The peer review process is a fundamental step in any research effort because scholars must use their knowledge of their field to aid others in making their work more effective and clear, just as we must do in this class.</dd>
<dt>product focus</dt>
<dd>The syllabus outlines the basic work expectations that will earn a specific letter grade and gives us details on how to assess our own work. We must go above and beyond if we wish to earn a grade above an 8, and Mayuko shares a related point: she accentuates the importance of working for an efficient and satisfying end product rather than focusing on a grade that we will receive. Even though this course is part of our GPA, it is more important to be working to create a high-quality finished product.</dd>
